        For most of my adult life, everyone else needed to change. It couldn&apos;t have been me,
        because I had done the work! I had gone through therapy, studied hard for my job skills,
        and I knew what not to be as a partner for women. And yet, I had consistent trouble in all
        of my high stakes relationships. Work, girlfriends, family, my wife before we got married,
        you name it. Everyone else sucked, not me!
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4">
        Eventually, this caught up with me. I&apos;ve lost more than one job, and I&apos;ve disappointed
        many women. One day, the truth of how closed off and hidden from my own self I was hit me in the
        face, when my (now) wife saw the real me plain as day and it broke her heart.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4">
        I knew at that moment that I didn&apos;t want to lose her. So I finally took a deeper look inward.
        I found <a href="https://relationshipschool.com/relationship-school-podcast/">the Relationship School podcast</a>
        and I faced my own bullshit. I hired a coach. I started taking personal responsibility for my life
        and owning my needs. A couple of years later I enrolled in and graduated from
        <a href="https://relationshipschool.com/relationshipmastery/">Relationship Mastery</a>
        and then got certified as a <a href="https://relationshipschool.com/level1-rct/">Relationship Coach</a>.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4">
        Today, I am in a rock solid and secure marriage that is not 50/50, it&apos;s 100 and 100.
        I own all of my part, and she owns all of her part. We talk about our needs openly and with
        loving support and challenge for each other. I am fully allowed to be myself in front of her
        without shame or fear that I will lose her love and connection. She knows it all, more than
        any other woman in my life has ever known.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4">
        At work, my coworkers look up to me. My boss told me that he&apos;s inspired by me. I know how
        to repair after a conflict. I know how to communicate to others what to expect of me and what I
        expect of them. I can share feedback and impact from a place of care for the other person and our
        relationship.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4">
        I still get stuck in life. I still make other people the problem sometimes. No matter how much we
        learn in this process, we are still going to have our triggers and blocks. Now I have the skills and
        resources to own my choices, get to repair, and make a change. That&apos;s what I want for you.

        a change? Talk to me today.
