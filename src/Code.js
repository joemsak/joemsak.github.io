          &nbsp;(Kannu has sub-domain multi-tenancy). The original developers
          have been gone since before my time, so I've had to explore and learn
          this codebase on my own since January 2019.

        <p>
          Since `Institution.current` is a known global, I can call an existing
          method that avoids requiring it as an argument in the wild. Similarly,
          there is already a scope for the inner-workings of
          `Institution.from_courses`. And while preparing this tour, I now see
          another clean up opportunity between these two screenshots for my next
          round of work!

          The policy files are rife with duplication and it's going to be quite a
          patient slow burn to get to the point where all policies have been
          consolidated and tidied up nicely, so I just try to clean them up as
          I run into them.

          The relevant bits above are the legacy hardcoded special cases for
          Stanford/Princeton. It took the co-founder a minute to realize what the
          original code was for, so I baked it into the new naming. We will see
          the old "in the wild" calls among the next group of changes.

          Replacing a complicated concern with plain code in new convenience

        <p>
          Unfortunately, despite good intentions, this concern was hard to follow.
          To boot, the code required for use in the wild was not convenient. In
          the following examples, you will hopefully note the removal of the
          dynamically created `get_setting` and `add_setting` methods in favor
          of plain old boring ruby hash access.

          It looks like `#allows_archive?` can now be re-written even simpler
          during my next round of work!

        <p>
          I hope this has made it easier for developers to follow and continue
          to improve the settings code for this model. And in case you're 
          wondering, it turns out there was only one other model which included
          `ModelSettings` and wasn't even using it as much. Some code has been
          left duplicated between the two models as a result, but I'm okay with
          that for now.

          In another quick sample, I'd like to demonstrate code from my last
          greenfield project that still has my name on most of the lines of code
          two years later. At a glance of various changes since I left, I can see
          that other devs were able to follow my intentions pretty well, which
          feels good.

        <p>
          I am still proud of this code because I architected the routes,
          controllers, and views such that each user-audience (mentors, students,
          ambassadors, judges, and admins) are guaranteed to the developer that
          the correct role has been authenticated. The code never needs to mix
          concerns or add switch cases for the differing roles.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a big believer in naming conventions, I set it up so that if an
          audience role is in your file's subdirectory hierarchy (such as
          `app/views/judges/resource/show.html.erb`) you are guaranteed the
          current_user is of that role, and that role's code features will work.
          Most duplicate templates and logic are shared via DRY, OOP extension.
        </p>

        <p>
          The one example I am sharing here is of the student &amp; mentor profile
          controllers with their shared concern. You'll note they have their own
          parent controllers, which you can trust that each has their own filters
          to guarantee the correct role authentication to the developers.
        </p>

        />

        <p>
          Looking back at this again today, I can see that maybe some defaults
          could be further baked in so that some of these methods are
          created automagically based on naming conventions. At least for now,
          it's easy to read how the concern is overwritten between the different
          roles.
        </p>

        />

        <p>
          Finally, on the one hand, I love that the other developers were able
          to follow the existing code and have added new behavior in the concern
          where it belongs. However, I see that it's probably time to prepare this
          class for future refactoring, so I did a quick and dirty gist of how I
          might begin those changes below.

          Of course, given that this is a first draft, I'd discuss where it's
          going with my teammates before taking it too far. I'd like to think
          this would get some good ideas flowing.
        </p>

        <p>
          I hope this page has served to give you a decent idea of my approach as
          a coder. I would be delighted for a chance to elaborate on anything
          of relevance to your team.
