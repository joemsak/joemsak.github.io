    "question": "What's with your 'outside of business hours' rates?",
    "answers": [
      "I charge a higher rate for taking on extra work outside of the normal 9â€“5 (US/Central) hours, because my free time is much more valuable to me."
    ]

  {
    "question": "Why no hourly rate?",
    "answers": [
      "Web development is specialized labor which involves a variety of tasks to achieve the end goals. Any one component of the project will require planning, meeting, writing, coding, testing, QAing, demoing, training, sketching, thinking during 'off' hours, system administration, deployment, and more. It's not only difficult to quantify these different tasks for line items, I find tracking hours to be just plain tedious. If you're not comfortable with that, we're probably not a good fit.",
      "Because of this, I prefer to invoice a flat rate for a guaranteed range of time that I will focus on our project. If you're reasonably unhappy with the results, I will put in a reasonable amount of extra work to make it right for you."

  {
    "question": "Do you offer a non-profit discount?",
    "answers": [
      "Yes, I offer a 50% discount to any non-profit organization which has a mission that I can ethically support. Submit your proof of 503c status and I will work for you on the discount.",
      "However, the caveat is that I will only commit to one non-consecutive month of NPO discounted work at a time, so I may not be available."
