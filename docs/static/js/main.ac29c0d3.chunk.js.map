The code never needs to mix concerns or add switch\n        cases for the differing roles. If an audience name is in your file's\n        subdirectory hierarchy (such as  `app/views/judges/resource/show.html.erb`)\n        you are guaranteed the current_user is of that role, and that role's code\n        features will work. Most duplicate templates and logic are shared via\n        DRY OOP extension.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        The one example I am sharing here is of the student &amp; mentor profile\n        controllers with their shared concern. You'll note they have their own\n        parent controllers, which you can trust that each has their own filters\n        to guarantee the correct role authentication to the developers.\n      </p>\n\n      <img\n        src={ profileControllerStudent }\n        alt=\"Sample of an automagically-scoped dynamic profile controller\"\n      />\n\n      <img\n        src={ profileControllerMentor }\n        alt=\"Sample of an automagically-scoped dynamic profile controller\"\n      />\n\n      <img\n        src={ profileControllerConcern }\n        alt=\"Sample of an automagically-scoped shared profile controller concern\"\n      />\n\n      <p>\n        Finally, on one hand I love that the other developers were able to follow the\n        example and have added new behavior where it belongs. However, I see that it's\n        probably time for this concern to be ready for future refactoring, so I\n        did a quick and dirty gist of how I might begin those changes below.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Profile controller concern quick rewrite</h3>\n\n      <Gist id=\"871cd16d04200ab6c16cfa95a52954e0\" />\n\n      <p>\n        Of course, given that this is a first attempt at rewriting, I'd want to\n        discuss where it's going with my teammates before taking it too far.
